<br><b>HTML</b>
<p>
<span
  HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> is a set of instructions one gives to 
  a computer and refers to the text that you see and 
  what it looks like. Your HTML document will also contain references to other documents, 
  images, videos, and links to other pages.
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>
<span>
  In HTML we create <b>elements</b> using opening and closing <b>tags</b> that give instructions on how to display or 
  treat the text or information between the tags. 
<br>
<br>
  HTML contains two types of Tags. The <b>inline tag</b> and the <b>block tag</b>. An inline 
  tag such as "br" deals only with the line it is in and may not need a closing
  tag. However a block tag such as "p" always needs a closing tag and creates an invisble 
  box around its text or contents.
<br><br>
  Some tags can contain something called an attribute. Attributes can give more complex instructions
  such as links to other pages or pull images into  the page you are creating. An example
  of this is the anchor tag "a," which can have the attribute "href." This attribute can link
  to another <a href = www.udacity.com> page. </a> You will see this in action if you click
  on the highlighted word page in this paragraph.
<br>
<br>
  When using the attribute for images "src" one must also provide a void tag that will provide
  a text response if the link to an image is broken.</br>
<br>
  In all of this one starts to realize the power and limitations of giving a computer instructions
  through HTML. You quickly learn that computers could be considered dumb due to their lack
  of interpretation skills.<em> Precision is key to good code.</em><br>

  <br> A webpage uses HTML as its structure and CSS as its style along with       JAVASCRIPT to manipulate these parts. A webpage can be broken down using     a Document Object Model (DOM), to be explained shortly or by visually       inspecting the page and breaking it down into segments or boxes.<br>
  <br>
     An HTML document can be written out in a DOM. The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML.

  <p><span>
      It closely resembles the structure of the
      documents it models. 

    <p><span>In the DOM, documents have a logical
        structure which is very much like a tree; to be more precise, it
        is like a "forest" or "grove", which can
        contain more than one tree. However, the DOM
        does not specify that documents must be <em>implemented</em> as a
        tree or a grove, nor
        does it specify how the relationships among objects be
        implemented. <em><b><span style="outline:1px solid red">The DOM is a logical model that may be implemented in any
        convenient manner.</span></b><br>
      <span> <br>It is possible to see how an Html document is organized by       going to the webpage opening the developer tools and inspecting the     elements and styles of the page.<br>

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
          elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
          draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother
          had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
        </p>
        <p>
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series
          of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes
          inside of boxes, and so on...

          When you read an HTML document as
          <em>text</em>, you see a wave of
          changing indentations going up and down the left side
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the
          more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

        <p>
          When writing code, programmers use special text editors
          (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the
          programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors
          will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you
          write an opening tag.

        Avoiding Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.

        CSS
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
